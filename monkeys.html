            <h3> monkeys</h3>
            <p>monkey is a common name that may refer to group or  species of mammals in part the simians
                group or species of mammals in part the simians descriptively to group of primaates such
                as families of new world monkeys and old world monkeys.many monkeys species that live primarily on the group
                such are also  active during the day (diurnal ).monkeys are generally considered to  be intelligent
                especialluy the old world monkeys of catarrini</p>
                <p>simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago.new world
                    monkeys are catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago old  world  monkeys and hominoide emerged 
                    within the catarrhine  monkeys some 25 million years ago extinict  basal simians  such  
                    as aegyptopithecus or parapithecus{35-32}million years ago eosimiidea and sometimes even 
                    the catarrini group are also considered monkeys by  primatologists .lemurs ,lorises  and galagos are   not monkeys
                    instead they are strepsirrhine primates .like  monkeys tarsiers are haplorhine primates how ever they ARE also
                    not monkeys </p>
                    <p>apes emerged within monkey as sister of the cercopithecidae in the catarrini so cladistically
                        they are monkeys as wells.there  has been some resistance to directly designate aps and humans
                        as  monkeys despite the scientific evidence so old world  monkey was   already realized by georges
                        louis leclerc comte de buffon in 18 th century monkeys including apes can be ditinguished from other
                        primates  by having only two pectoral nipples ,a pendulous ,penis and lack of sensory whiskers</p>
